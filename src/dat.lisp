Reads characters from the INPUT-STREAM until a #\\Newline is found, and
store the characters read into the SEQUENCE, from START, up to below
END.  If END is reached before the #\\Newline character is read, then
reading stops there and the third result value is NIL.  The #\Newline
character is not stored.   No other slot of the SEQUENCE is modified
than those between START and POSITION.

RETURN:         VALUE, POSITION, NEWLINE-SEEN-P

VALUE:          Either SEQUENCE or EOF-VALUE depending on whether an
                end-of-file has been seen.

SEQUENCE:       A sequence (OR LIST VECTOR).  If specialized, the vector
                must have an element-type that is a supertype of the
                stream element-type.  If a fill-pointer is present, it
                is ignored.

POSITION:       The index in the SEQUENCE of the first element not
                written. (<= START POSITION (OR END (LENGTH BUFFER)))


NEWLINE-SEEN-P: Whether a #\\Newline has been read.

INPUT-STREAM:   an input stream.  The element-type of the INPUT-STREAM
                must be a subtype of CHARACTER.

EOF-ERROR-P:    a generalized boolean. The default is true.  If true,
                then an END-OF-FILE error is signaled upon end of file.

EOF-VALUE:      an object. The default is NIL.

RECURSIVE-P:    a generalized boolean. The default is NIL.  If
                RECURSIVE-P is true, this call is expected to be
                embedded in a higher-level call to read or a similar
                function used by the Lisp reader.

START, END:     bounding index designators of SEQUENCE.
                The defaults for START and END are 0 and NIL, respectively.
