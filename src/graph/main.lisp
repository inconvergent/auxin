  "create undirected graph instance with no spatial awareness.

since the graph is undirected. all edges are normalized such that the smallest
vertex is first. any checks that compare edges in any sense will return the
same value for (a b) and (b a).

assuming the following graph:

  x-y-u
  |   |
a-b-c-d-o
  |
  y

this terminology is used:
  - ab, by and do are (simple) filaments.
  - bcd and bxyud are segments.
  - (simple) filaments are segments.
  - bcduyx(b) is a cycle.
  - b and d are multi intersection points/vertices
  - a, y, o are dead-ends.

arguments:
  - adj-size: initial size of adjacency hash-table
    (total number of verts)
  - adj-inc: size multiplier for hash-table
  - set-size: initial size of vert adjecency list
    (typical number of edges per vert)
  - set-inc: size multiplier vert adjecency list
default values should usually work fine."
